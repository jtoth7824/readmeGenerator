# Readme Generator

## Description

This project utilizes Node.js to create a professional looking readme file based upon user inputs.  The application asks the user a series of questions for which the supplied answers are used to construct the readme sections.  The application asks for a title, installation instructions, usage instructions, a license type, contributions, any applicable tests and finally email and GitHub username in order to create the Readme.

## Installation

* Copy the folder 'generatorCode' containing all the application files locally to one's machine.
* Install node.js to computer, if not already present.
    * Node.js can be installed from [here](#https://nodejs.org/en/)
* In a terminal window, install 'inquirer' using npm
    * **npm install inquirer --save**

## Usage

This application requires Node.js to be installed.  It also requires the user to have installed 'Inquirer' via the node package manager (npm).  Once these items have been installed, the user can launch the application from a terminal window as follows:

**node index.js**

The application will proceed to ask the user a series of questions in order to build the readme file.
