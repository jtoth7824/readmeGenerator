# Readme Generator

## Description

This project utilizes Node.js to create a professional looking readme file based upon user inputs.  The application asks the user a series of questions for which the supplied answers are used to construct the readme sections.  The application asks for a title, installation instructions, usage instructions, a license type, contributions, any applicable tests and finally email and GitHub username in order to create the Readme.

## Installation

* Install node.js to computer, if not already present.
    * Node.js can be installed from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Copy all the application files in folder 'generatorCode' locally to one's machine.
* In a terminal window where you copied the files, install 'inquirer' using node package manager (npm)
    * **npm install inquirer --save**

## Usage

This application requires Node.js to be installed.  It also requires the user to have installed 'Inquirer' via npm.  (See [Installation](#installation) section.)  Once these items have been installed, the user can launch the application from a terminal window as follows:

**node index.js**

The application will proceed to ask the user a series of questions in order to build the readme file.
